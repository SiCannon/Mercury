- page status: loading, loaded, error

- paging info cache: include search parameters

- find a way of finding an item in the list to show where it now is
	- idea: go back to the same page at first but start an async process to find the item and indicate to the user that this is happening

- error page: do not replace URL with /#/error but keep erroring URL so that user can go back
	
- unit tests for all JS files

- unit tests for C# files?

- error handling:
	- exception when call ArtistService.get() with no id specified, otherwise the GET returns a list of artists
	- error message when invalid id on artist detail page

- refactor mpEditableArtistTag.js
	- originalTag is local
	- get input element during creation
	- unit tests should ensure these changes are valid

- remove TagId from TagDto, and maybe remove TagDto altogether?

- "none found" message on listing page

- "loading..." messages

- artist tags broken in IE

- test in Firefox and on mobile

- don't allow entire tag text to be deleted

- move views to templates

- Get Releases

- Angular: can we have multiple instances of the same controller?

	- this would allow us to make the paging service into a controller
	- but also: can we have two artist edits on the same page at the same time for different artists?

- Bootstrap LESS

new items:
	add new item
	in watch function, set new item as NEW
	NEW means it is selected
	as soon as any item is ok-ed it is no longer new
